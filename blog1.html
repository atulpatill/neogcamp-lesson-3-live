                <h1>5 habits that will boost your personality.</h1>
            <small>August, 2021</small>
            <p> Some people try to develop new habits every day. But, they fail terribly as they lack consistency. I have a fool proof plan that won't only boost your personality instantly but also make you the influencer in your squad.  
                Note: To influence others you need to work on yourself first. 
                 <br>
                Here are 5 habits that will boost your personality.
                <br>
                1.	Wake up early.
                The first and foremost tip is to wake up early and see the first light. I have seen people who try to polish every possible habit. But, they don’t detect their wrong sleeping patterns. To wake up early you need to sleep early. Also, make your to-do list the night before to have a productive day. 
                
                <br>
                
                2.	Educate yourself.
                The actual knowledge that will benefit you in real life is when you educate yourself based on your interest. Sit with yourself in peace and analyze what are your preferences.
                According to your interest, set a goal and work towards it every single day. Take complete advantage of the internet and master your preferred subject.

                3.	Communicate even if you are a shy kid.
                I understand, it's easier said than done. But, no matter how shy you are, you have to socialize with somebody somewhere. It can be in family functions or on the professional front. 
                However, I have an app that boosted my personality as an individual i.e. “Clubhouse” you read that right. The most hyped yet amazing app that lets you connect with people around the globe. It is different from other applications. Specifically, it is an audio-only app. You can participate in any room as a listener as well as a speaker. 
                <br>
                
                4.	Read books that match your current situation. 
                Okay! This one is my favourite. Suppose if you are coping up with a situation and can’t find a way or you don’t want to share it with your friends. Then, it is the finest idea to read a book that matches your current circumstances. It will guide you. You can't deny the fact that books are absolutely the best way to boost your personality.

                5.	Maintain a habit journal.
                Reading books and writing in your journal is equally important to boost your personality. Now, that you have developed the habits. It is mandatory to track your habits. Therefore, you have to maintain a habit journal that will help you to stay consistent and motivate you every single day. 
                <br>
                On the whole, my work is done here. Now, it’s you who has to shift the rest of the bricks and build your dream castle.
