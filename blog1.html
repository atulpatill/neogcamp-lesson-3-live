                <h1>Education System In India</h1>
            <small>April, 2021</small>
            <p>94% of engineering graduates are not fit for hiring, says this IT stalwart .
                CP Gurnani, CEO & MD of Tech Mahindra, has said that 94% of engineering graduated were not fit for hiring. “The top 10 IT companies take only 6% of the engineering graduates. What happens to the remaining 94%? 
                engineers have you ever thought that your get a good stuff which will help you to be a professional in your future. surveys says that 94% not fit and i am dam sure about it .
                India is once a great place for education but now completely opposite .
                when I went to a school and ask students “A for” then 99% students said “Apple”.
                from our schooldays everyone started to do spoon feeding which became a habit so we stop thinking .
                have you ever tried to relate what you studied to pratical usage. this what lacking . i say India has lots of good talents which other countries use and which India cannot use. why so ?
                just think a word that start with “A”. what comes into your mind ? i think you got Apple into mind.
                yes 70 to 80 % mind says apple. this is because from our child hood we were repetedly hearing and saying ” A for apple” why dont we try for different . most of us are not allowed to do so. because they need no answers given in book or what teachers said because we were not give an chance to think new.
                that’s why everyone say we were not fit for jobs. because in this present world everyone need someone who can think differently than others and which is useful for them .According to the HRD ministry, India has 6,214 engineering and technology institutions which are enrolling 2.9 million students. Around 1.5 million engineers are released into the job market every year. But the dismal state of higher education in India ensures that they simply do not have adequate skills to be employed. Graduates are collecting their degrees despite not being skilled enough to be a productive part of the Indian economy. so in order to come out of that crowed we should think differently this is what companies want. and I request parents to think before you join your children in engineering.
                so think before you act.
                Major problems with engineering education in India
                1. Syllabus not updated regularly:
                The course contents do not focus on areas which will actually help in the job industry after employment. There is a big gap between what the market needs and what Indian education equips its future employees with. Despite exponential changes in science and technology round the world, the syllabus is hardly ever updated just like train for 2G and what 4G outcome.
                2. Lack of quality teachers:
                There are more than 33,023 colleges in India granting degrees. There are not enough quality teachers for all of these educational institutes.  unlike other parts of the world, the Indian faculty is not comprised of the very best of the industries who have the skills to create brilliant students.Most educated engineers join teaching as a profession not because of passion, but because they have to earn a livelihood. The few good professors prefer administrative positions because of lower intellectual demands coupled with higher pay packages.
                3. Lack of innovation and research:
                Students need to be motivated enough to innovate or think for themselves.”Why do we lack innovation in India? Because, we don’t allow questioning. We don’t promote inquisitiveness. If a child asks questions in school, he is asked to sit down. This should not go on. We need to promote inquisitiveness, children should ask questions.”Students must be given the space and scope to think and innovate, to question and come up with solutions. This applies to both school education and higher education.
                5. Lack of skill-based education:
                Skill-based education is another immediate need. Engineering students need to have hands-on training on the basis of the problems they are likely to encounter in the real world.
                6. Importance of college name:
                According to the Aspiring Minds report, companies are prone to visiting only top colleges to recruit potential employees. Thus, resumes from relatively unknown colleges do not get shortlisted.This not only creates a lack in equal opportunities, but also causes a deficiency of quality employees as this process ignores a huge number of meritorious students who do not study in top tier colleges.
                7. Ease of permission from state governments:
                A major cause of mushrooming engineering colleges is the ease with which state governments grant permission to little-known barely-trained educational trusts and organisations to set up the same.
                8. Disregard of essential soft skills:
                Soft skills have become very important in the present job industry, but they are routinely ignored in educational institutes.
