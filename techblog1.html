                <h1>Methods of HTTP & HTTPS</h1>
            <small>May, 2021</small>
            <p>So, whenever you type for any URL or open any website, do you see those "htpp://" and "https://" ? and wonder what are they? and how they work? If yes then this blog post is for you. In this blog I'll tell you about all methods of HTTP & HTTPS. Before that let me tell you what is an HTTP ? HTTP is a short form of Hyper Text Transfer Protocol, It works as a meditator between client and server. It also use to share data between server and browser. What is HTTPS ? HTTPS is Hyper text transfer protocol secure, This is secure form of HTTP, this was introduced to improve cyber security of the server. In this we add 'Secure Socket Layer' into HTTP to make it secure from hackers. In HTTPS the data shared between server and browser is encrypted because SSL is installed on that web server. so next time when you open any website and if you feel its suspicious do check that it is HTTP based or HTTPS based. Now you know what HTTP and HTTPS is now let me tell you methods of HTTPS. There are four method which we use to do CRUD Operation(Create-Read-Update-Delete), These four methods are as Follows.
                <br>

                1) GET 2) PUT/PATCH 3) POST 4) DELETE
                <br>
                
                Each API request uses a HTTP method, so Let's talk about each methods in details.
                <br> 
                1) GET Method -> GET is considered as Safe Method and others are consider as a unsafe method, Its is use to read data on server. Using HTTP request it will not have any impact on the resource, But using GET request it will only give you data that you are looking for, And to get that data you need to modify your request in such a way that, you need to mention all the parameter you are looking for in URL. In simple words, your GET method is use to retrieve the data whatever information specified in your URL. It will give you all the data that you are looking for that you have shown in URL.
                <br>
                
                2) PUT/PATCH -> It is specifically use to update the data, It is also called as Idempotent method because calling PUT HTTP method multiple times will not have any impact on data that you are already uploaded or updated. Once you have updated something even though you are trying to click on send button 100 times it will not create/update multiple data again and again but it will only overwrite the data. Unlike POST HTTP method if you are sending same data againw, It will create multiple users each and every time you click on send button.
                <br>
                
                PATCH Method -->It have capabilities to modify data. It is pretty much simlar toPUT Http method but basic difference is using PUT you send entire data to update but using PATCH you only send the specific data you want to update.
                <br>
                3) POST Method --> It is use to send data to the server, using POST method you create anything you want to create.
                <br>
                
                4) DELETE Method --> Using DELETE method you delete data which you have mention in URL.
                <br>
                
                That's it folks, hope after reading this you understand what is HTTP & HTTPS and its different methods.
